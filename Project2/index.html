                My text. Greenhouse gases trap heat and make the planet warmer.
                Human activities are responsible for almost all of the increase
                in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150 years.1
                The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities
                in the United States is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation.

                More text; what are the causes of CO2? What countries have more CO2 emissions?
                A carbon dioxide equivalent or CO2 equivalent,
                abbreviated as CO2-eq is a metric measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases
                on the basis of their global-warming potential (GWP),
                by converting amounts of other gases to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide
                with the same global warming potential.
                For example, the GWP for methane is 25 and for nitrous oxide 298.
                This means that emissions of 1 million metric tonnes of methane and
                nitrous oxide respectively is equivalent to emissions of 25 and 298 million
                metric tonnes of carbon dioxide.
