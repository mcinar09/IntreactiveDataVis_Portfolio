## Visualization Portfolio
I created this portfolio as a part of my class, Interactive Data Visualizations in Fall 2020 at CUNY Graduate Center.

Carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels,have risen dramatically since the start of the industrial revolution. Most of the worldâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions come from a relatively small number of countries. In this project, we will look at some countries' <b>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</b> and the <b>Gross Domestic Product GDP</b> from 1990 - 2017 to investigate whether or not there is a relationship between economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions.
